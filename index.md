I'm a PhD level data scientist with 10 years of experience in statistics, bioinformatics, machine learning and data management.  I have a particular interest in reproducible analyses:  making it easy to reproduce environment, data and code on another machine.  Our team has implemented a system for cataloging [public data](https://chen.datacatalog.lib.wayne.edu/
) to make them compliant with the [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) principles for data analyses.  We are also implementing a solution for sharing computational workflows using [Docker](https://github.com/ncarrut/arsenicpilot).  
Lately I've also been interested in [spectral clustering](/spectralclustering/) and other analyses that use kernel distance matrices, (eg. support vector machines).  

#### More Information

I recieved my PhD from Wayne State in 2008 and a MS in Data Science & Business Analytics also from Wayne State in 2019.  My background in machine learning and statistics is strong and my technical skills include R and python programming and workflow and environment management.  I work for the Wayne State University Proteomics Facility handling data analysis and management.  
I've written over 20 [scientific publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=BArOJrIAAAAJ&hl=en).
