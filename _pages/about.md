I'm a PhD level data scientist with 10 years of experience in statistics, bioinformatics, machine learning and data management.  I handle the day-to-day data analysis needs of the Wayne State University Proteomics Core facility and have a particular interest in [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) principles for data analyses.  To that end our team has implemented systems for reproducible data analysis and for cataloging public data.  Lately I've also been interested in spectral clustering and other analyses that use kernel distance matrices, (eg. support vector machines).  

#### More Information

I recieved my PhD from Wayne State in 2008 and a MS in Data Science & Business Analytics also from Wayne State in 2019.  My background in machine learning and statistics is strong and my technical skills include R and python programming and workflow and environment management.  
I've written over 20 [scientific publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=BArOJrIAAAAJ&hl=en).
